# CHROMA, sleek themes for Nintendo Switch

CHROMA is an NXTheme project that aims to (hopefully) bring sleek designs to the Switch interface. The intent here was to turn one year's worth of accumulated knowledge in Switch theming into full-fledged and coherent theme packs. While I don't consider the end result anywhere near perfect, great attention has still been given to overall UI consistency.

It comes in **8 layout variants for the home screen** (more specifically the game row), and it's pre-bundled with a few color schemes.

**Important: set your console to dark mode before using CHROMA** (System Settings > Themes > Basic Black)

## Features

**Layout variants (home screen)**

- **Default:** slightly inspired by the PS5 layout. Icons are rounded and the highlighted game appears as a card. This layout leaves enough room to put a custom background image.
- **Default Large Icons:** same as the *Default* layout but with larger icons.
- **Default w/ Sidebar for Applet Icons:** self-explanatory.
- **Compact Rounded:** rounded icons. When a game is highlighted, its label overlaps the game's image.
- **Regular Square:** big square icons, with a sleek game highlight animation.
- **Regular Rounded:** same as the *Regular Square* layout but icons are rounded.
- **Cards:** similar to the *Default* layout, but the game row is symmetrically aligned with the highlighted card, and icons are square.
- **Cards alt rounded:** another take to the *Cards* layout, rounded elements and the game's label is below the game's icon.

**Color schemes**

- **B&W** (base color scheme)
- **Terra:** earthy colors inspired by Monokai: light green, brown and hints of pink.
- **Terra Mint:** less vibrant tones than Terra with grayish brown, mint green and hints of beige.
- **Aqua:** aquamarine and deep blue colors.
  - **Aqua Breeze:** alt version with gradients.
- **Murasaki:** light purple with hints of beige and pale orange.
- **Neo Famicom:** gray tones and colored buttons inspired by the SNES console.
- **Red Wine:** scarlet tones with some gradients.

## Editing CHROMA

Please note that CHROMA involves very intricate layouts as they massively rely on BFLAN animations and convenient reuse of pre-existing UI elements (which is often the case with my NXTheme releases). You will most likely have a hard time to make edits without breaking something. Most colors are dynamically handled (i.e. through animations), so making color changes isn't as straightforward as editing hex values. That being said, if you're willing to go down the rabbit hole, consider using Layout Editor.

## Known issues

- Game scrolling sometimes breaks in layouts that use a sidebar, similar to *Unison R*. No way found to fix that, unfortunately.
